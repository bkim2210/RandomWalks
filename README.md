# RandomWalks
 
This project utilizses Python to generate data for a random walk, and uses Matplotlib to generate visual representation of the data.  A random walk is where there is not clear direction, but it is made by a series of random chance all left up to chance. Random walks models many real-world situations. As random walks have applications in nature, physics, biology, chemistry, and economics.
The project helped me learn about randomwalks, matplotlib and pyplots for data visulazation. 
An example of the output can be found in Randomwalk.png.
